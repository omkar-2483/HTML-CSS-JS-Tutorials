    <p>An Id is an attribute, a unique identifier assigned to only one HTML element within a page. <br>
        A class attribute lets you give the same name to multiple HTML elements. That way,you can easily change their
        look or behavior all at once. <br>
        single element can have multiple classes and multiple elements can have same class <br>
        each element has only one id and it can not be assigned for any other element <br>
        In css class is targeted by dot(.) <br>
        In css id is targeted by hash(#) <br>
        Id is also used for link generation. in browser search tab if you put a link#id then it redirect us to that id element in page whose link we are providing. <br>
